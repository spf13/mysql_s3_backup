h3. Backing up your MySQL database to S3

This is a fork of the code examples for the blog post available at "http://pauldowman.com/2009/02/08/mysql-s3-backup/":http://pauldowman.com/2009/02/08/mysql-s3-backup/
I have modified these examples for my own use.  I have removed the incremental backup because I don't need it and I have added the ability to specify how many backups to keep in s3 in the config.rb.
